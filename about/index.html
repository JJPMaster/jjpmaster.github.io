<body><h1>About me</h1>
I primarily "<abbr title="Use it for various things that have absolutely nothing to do with contributing to the software itself">contribute</abbr>" to the MediaWiki software (that's what powers Wikipedia) in various ways, as well as <s>exploiting</s> using the MediaWiki API to do things that may or may not be classified as "cool".

You can find my Wikimedia account <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JJPMaster">here</a>, and my Uncyclopedia account <a href="https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/User:JJPMaster">here</a>.

<h2>Something else</h2>
I first discovered programming when I discovered the Swift Playgrounds app on my very proprietary Apple™™©™™©™™®™©™®®™ iPad. It took me a while to realize that variables aren't the same across every project you create. I later began to create extremely simple and useless programs in Visual Basic .NET, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/812487418786611230/833417609701490752/unknown.png">as Chlod and Firefly know</a>. Then when I discovered Uncyclopedia, I re-opened Visual Studio Code for the first time in several years, and began to port user scripts from Wikipedia onto Uncyc, before I began to <i>try</i> to create my own scripts as well as an unapproved bot; some of them can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/JJPMaster?tab=repositories">GitHub repositories</a><br/><br/>...And then now, where I have developed an interest in deep learning. I couldn't even install any of the Node.js libraries properly.
<h2>What about languages?</h2>
I primarily work with Python and JavaScript (especially Node.js), but sometimes you may catch me using PHP, Ruby, or maybe even C#!

<h2>Finally...</h2>
I play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)">Celeste</a>, if you weren't able to tell that by my profile picture. More information about that can be found on the <a href="/misc">"miscellaneous" subpage</a>.

Okay, <b>bye!</b>
